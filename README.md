# LegiAgent: Law-Governed Multi-Agent Evolution via Deterministic Manifold Projection

This repository contains the official implementation of **LegiAgent**, a framework designed to ensure legal compliance in Large Language Model (LLM) based multi-agent simulations through Deterministic Manifold Projection (DMP).

---

## 🚀 Overview
LegiAgent bridges the gap between natural language tax statutes and executable agent behaviors. By mapping legal clauses into a geometric manifold, we provide a mathematical guarantee for agent compliance in complex socio-economic environments.
